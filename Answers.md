1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React JS is a library for building applications effectively and rapidly and solves the problem of providing a smooth experience for users despite increased complexity. By using components, logic can be split into modules and de-coupled from the overall hierarchy in order to facilitate easier changes to applications. In addition, React JS leans heavily on vanilla Javascript so that there is no heavy reliance on its API and Javascript principles still apply.

To think in React means to think in terms of components and separating logic into meaningful and re-usable modules of function and rendering groups.

3. Describe state.
